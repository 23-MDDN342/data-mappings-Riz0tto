# 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

## Modifying the Assignment 2 Faces

The faces I made for assignment 3 were very minimalist and cartoony, so implementing them into this project was challenging. When their features were mapped onto a human face they looked odd and creepy. To preserve the style of the faces, I decided not to accurately map the eyes, as I believe them to be the core of the original design, along with the circular head. However I did create a new mouth using curve shapes accurately mapping to the points on the lips. I was impressed by how well these points on the face were tracked, allowing for smooth and dynamic expressions.
